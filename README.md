# datafun-07-ml
# Starting the New Project

Open your browser and navigate to GitHub.

Create a new repository named datafun-07-ml. Make sure to initialize it with a default README.md.

Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/albertokabore/datafun-07-ml

Open your new project repository folder in the Documents folder of your machine in VS Code (if you haven't already).

In VS Code, add a useful .gitignore file with a line for .vsode/ and .venv/ and whatever else doesn't need to be tracked in the repository.

```.gitignore
       1. .vscode/
       2. .venv/
```

In VS Code, edit your README.md to record your commands, process, and notes so far. 

Use the terminal to git add your files and folders to source control, and git commit your changes with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit"), and git push the changes up to GitHub.

```PowerShell
git add .

git push origin main
```
